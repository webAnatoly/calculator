# Installation of new modules

1. Install new module in way you prefer or skip this step if information about new module is already present in ```package.json```
2. Make sure that your docker-container is up and running otherwise execute ```docker-compose up```
3. Execute ```npm run install-in-docker``` - it will install new module and will restart docker-container after installation
