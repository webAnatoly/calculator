# Remote Assembly react native starter kit

## How to use it: 
1. Run server ra-api-gateway(server side repository)

2. In command line type ```npm start```

3. In login screen use credentials test@test.com - password to sign in.

4. If there is a need to prettify your code - run command ```npm run lint``` - it will reformat your code.

If you don't have ability to run server - listen to sign in action in session reducer and change isLogedIn key to true on that event.
