# Get started


## Cloning the right way

To build your own app on top of the Starter Kit, fork or mirror this repository. For serious use we recommend [mirroring using these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/), since you can't make a fork of a public repository private on GitHub. To contribute to Starter Kit development or just playing around, forking is the way to go.


## Requirements

1. **Install [Node 5.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)** - Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. 
3. **[Disable safe write in your editor](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#adjusting-your-text-editor)** to assure hot reloading works properly.
4. On a Mac? You're all set. If you're on Linux or Windows, complete the steps for your OS below.  
 
**On Linux:**  

 * Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch. [Here's why](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/6).    
`echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p` 

**On Windows:** 
 
* **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Some node modules may rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.
* **Install C++ Compiler**. Browser-sync requires a C++ compiler on Windows. [Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) comes bundled with a free C++ compiler. Or, if you already have Visual Studio installed: Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).


## Installation
**Run the setup script**. `npm run setup`


## Having Issues? Try these things first.
1. Make sure you ran all steps in [Get started](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/blob/master/README.md#get-started) including the [initial machine setup](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot#initial-machine-setup).
2. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll see this: `babel-node: command not found`.
3. Install the latest version of Node. Or install [Node 5.12.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v5.12.0/) if you're having issues on Windows. Node 6 has issues on some Windows machines.
4. Make sure files with names that begin with a dot (.babelrc, .editorconfig, .eslintrc) are copied to the project directory root. This is easy to overlook if you copy this repository manually.
5. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It may cause issues with file watches.
6. Delete any .eslintrc that you're storing in your user directory. Also, disable any ESLint plugin / custom rules that you've enabled within your editor. These will conflict with the ESLint rules defined in this project.
7. Make sure you don't have NODE_ENV set to production on your machine. If you do then the [development dependencies won't be installed](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/400#issuecomment-290497767). Here's [how to check](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27939821/26180).
8. Tip: Things to check if you get an `npm run lint` error or build error:

    * If ESW found an error or warning in your project (e.g. console statement or a missing semi-colon), the lint thread will exit with `Exit status 1`. To fix: 

      1. Change the `npm run lint` script to `"esw webpack.config.* src tools; exit 0"`
      1. Change the `npm run lint:watch` script to `"esw webpack.config.* src tools --watch; exit 0"`

      > Note: Adding `exit 0` will allow the npm scripts to ignore the status 1 and allow ESW to print all warnings and errors.
  
    * Ensure the `eslint`/`esw` globally installed version matches the version used in the project. This will ensure the `esw` keyword is resolved.
